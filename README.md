# Traffic Enforcement Assistance System AI Part

Traffic Enforcement Assistance System is a web application that assists university auxiliary police in handling traffic offenses using AI-powered License Plate Reader. 

This repository contains the AI server part of the project. This part of code can be hosted locally or on cloud computing platform (e.g. I had hosted this part on Digital Ocean as FLASK API).

The web UI part of the system can be found in [here](https://github.com/Janson-L/Traffic-Enforcement-Assistance-System-WebUI)

This project is carried out to fulfill the course requirement of Workshop II (BITU3923) in UTeM.
